          <h3>Quandaries of Open Source</h3>
          <span>The open-source software movement has been shaped by the public writing of some of its biggest contributors.  For example, the essay <a href = https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cathedral_and_the_Bazaar&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1513348734631000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFshdrBrtF-p5vpPG4_1AgLWsLewA>The Cathedral and the Bazaar</a>, written by Eric S. Raymond, is largely attributed with affecting the decision by Netscape to open-source their browser, <a href = https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Firefox&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1513348734632000&amp;usg=AFQjCNH0FOcgqI0c5_8iV9N19NQOQ8_OHQ > leading eventually </a> to the creation of Mozilla Firefox.  Another famous open essay that has had a large impact on the community is <a href = https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.benkler.org/CoasesPenguin.html&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1513348734632000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGkKkZwJixbgDUpaDgbD_WLuSZcxg > Coase’s Penguin </a>, by Yochai Benkler.</span>

          <h3>
            Requirements
          </h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <span>In this essay, you will explore a topic relating to a challenge faced by the open-source community and some possible solutions to that issue.  You will write about the different sides of the issue, citing references and making that side’s argument as strongly as possible, and then you will write about your own opinion on the matter, citing as many resources as you need for each piece.  See the potential topics list below.</span>
            </li>
            <li>
              <span> In addition, I ask that you consider making your essay open to the public by adding it to our course website.  I will not require this—I simply would like to encourage people to do so.  I ask this in the spirit of open essays impacting the community, as described in the opening lines of this document.  This will, of course, count toward your weekly pull request requirement (one time).</span>
            </li>
            <li>
              <span>The essay should be at least 1500 words.  You may format it how you like, but it should be readable and easy to follow.  If you intend to greatly exceed 1500 words (i.e. 3000+), please discuss with me why you feel the need to do so.</span>
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>
            How you will be graded
          </h3>
              <p>I will assess you on:</p>
              <ul>
                <li> <span> The quality and depth of your research, </span> </li>
                <li> <span> The quality (clarity, eloquence, organization, fluidity, etc.) of your argument, and </span> </li>
                <li> <span> Your use of well-placed references to create context and understanding, and the citations thereof. </span> </li>
              </ul>
              <p>See the rubric below.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>
            <span>Citations</span>
          </h3>
          <p> Ideally, your references should be freely available online, and you should cite them with simple footnotes, with a References section at the end of the essay.  The References section can be in any reasonable, consistent format you desire, so long as it is clear what form of media the reference takes, and how I may obtain it if I’d like (e.g. a hyperlink).  I understand you may not be able to ensure that all references are freely available online.  </p>

          <h3>
            <span>Rubric</span>
          </h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <span>              A 5 or 6 essay will accomplish all of the above stated requirements. It will present cogent and exciting insights that go beyond what’s been discussed in class or what is already present in your resources, using novel and relevant references, and display proof of a thoroughly researched topic.</span>
            </li>
            <li><span>A 4 essay will do the above, but perhaps one of the three areas mentioned above does not come to fruition. It might also lack substantive discussion of what I believe is a vitally important argument.</li></span>
            <li><span>A 3 or 2 essay misses the mark in more than one area above. It may be very surface-level and/or show a lack of comprehension of the topic. It likely summarizes instead of interprets.</li></span>
            <li><span>A 1 or 0 is incomplete, entirely based in summary, and fails to accomplish any of the three areas.</span></li>
          </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>
            <span>Dates and Submissions</span>
          </h3>
          <li><span>January 10/11th, before class: Submit an outline and a sample paragraph.  The outline should include all topics of discussion and references that you intend to be in the final paper.  It should present a well-thought-out argument and be a complete description of what you hope to present.  The sample paragraph should be a draft of an entire paragraph</span></li>
          <li><span>January 16th, before class: Rough draft due.  We will be workshopping the essays with fellow classmates, so this is a hard deadline.</span></li>
          <li><span>January 19th, before class: Final paper due.</span></li>
          <p>I will, as stated in the course expectations sheet, take off points for late work.  Late work will also likely cause your participation in class to be substandard, affecting your Process grade.</p>

          <h3>
            <span>Potential Topics</span>
          </h3>
          <li><span>The past, present, and future of the free software versus open-source software movements.  How does the discussion on ideals versus practicality, rooted in the history of the software engineering as a whole, move forward to something that continues to allow for the kind of community that so many developers have desired?</span></li>
          <li><span>Like any mostly-online community, the open source community can be a less-than-welcoming place for people who consider themselves to be from underrepresented groups.  Discover some of the instances of mistreatment to such individuals and some of the steps taken by the community to address this issue.  In your opinion, has it been enough?  Why or why not?</span></li>
          <li><span>How do you make money as a company if your product is open source?  Companies like Wordpress, Redhat, Anaconda Inc (previously Continuum Analytics), the Mozilla Corporation, and many others are making this happen.  Analyze a few of their basic business models, and then discuss the challenges and potential gains from open-sourcing your software as a company.  A related topic includes how companies allow and benefit from allowing their employees to work on open-source software that the company itself has no claim over.</span></li>
          <li><span>A growing concern in the open-source community is maintainer burnout.  As time goes on, maintainers of large libraries receive more and more regular requests for updates, and in the interest of keeping their software useful (especially to companies), the maintainers work immensely long hours to keep their code up-to-date.  This often comes without much else incentive, and can cause maintainers to abandon these libraries to which they have dedicated a great deal of time.  Explore this issue and potential solutions to the problem.</span></li>
          <li><span>How has the open-source community engaged with the legal system?  What role have licenses played, and what role do you see them playing in the future?</span></li>
          <li><span>A topic of your choosing, provided you discuss it with me and I accept your proposal.</span></li>
